# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **QuotaGroup API reference docs** — Expanded README QuotaGroup Planning section with explicit Microsoft.Quota endpoint patterns (`groupQuotas`, `groupQuotas/{name}/subscriptions`, `quotaAllocations/{location}` GET/PATCH), request payload example, regional-scope notes, and operational guidance for throttling/retry and read-after-write validation.
- **QuotaGroup request-status API docs and runnable example** — Added README coverage for `quotaAllocationRequests` list/get endpoints and async behavior (`EntityAlreadyExists` duplicate in-progress request handling), plus a runnable script example in `examples/QuotaGroup-AllocationRequest-Example.ps1`.

### Fixed
- **Quota-group bearer token compatibility** — `Get-QuotaApiBearerToken` now safely handles `Get-AzAccessToken` responses where `.Token` is a `SecureString`, preventing authorization failures in quota-group discovery/plan/apply on newer Az module builds.

### Changed
- **README audit** — Added "What's New" section; expanded Features list with lifecycle, placement, spot, JSON output, inventory, and deployment mapping; added 8 missing parameters to Parameters table (`-ShowSpot`, `-ShowPlacement`, `-DesiredCount`, `-NoQuota`, `-SubMap`, `-RGMap`, `-AllowMixedArch`, `-MaxRetries`); added `Az.ResourceGraph` to Requirements; added lifecycle/retirement and inventory use cases; added lifecycle row to Quick Comparison table
- **ROADMAP audit** — Marked 9 shipped backlog items as complete (Fleet Planning, Agent Integration, Module Structure, Backward-Compatible Wrapper, ARG Current VM Inventory, Cross-Subscription Discovery, Deployment Density, Spot Pricing)
- **Branch cleanup** — Deleted 19 stale remote branches (15 squash-merged, 4 abandoned); enabled `delete_branch_on_merge` repo setting to auto-delete PR branches after merge

### Added
- `.github/workflows/stale-branches.yml` — Weekly scheduled workflow that auto-deletes branches older than 30 days with no open PRs (protects `main` and `traffic-data`)

## [1.14.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **`-SubMap` deployment mapping** — New switch parameter that produces a Subscription Map sheet in the lifecycle XLSX export. Groups affected VMs by subscription with VM count, SKU list, and region list. Works with both `-LifecycleScan` (ARG-based) and `-LifecycleRecommendations` (file-based). Enriches each row with Risk Level and Risk Reasons from lifecycle analysis results, with color-coded cells (red=High, amber=Medium, green=Low).
- **`-RGMap` deployment mapping** — New switch parameter that produces a Resource Group Map sheet with the same enrichment as `-SubMap` but grouped by subscription + resource group. Both flags can be used together.
- **SubscriptionId extraction from RESOURCE LINK** — When input files lack a dedicated SubscriptionId column (common with Azure portal exports), the subscription GUID is extracted from the `RESOURCE LINK` URL via regex. Falls back gracefully when neither source is available.
- **Deployment map in JSON output** — `deploymentMap` object with `groupBy` and `rows` properties included in `-JsonOutput` when `-SubMap` or `-RGMap` is set.
- **`-Tag` filter for `-LifecycleScan`** — New hashtable parameter to filter live VM inventory scans by Azure resource tags. Supports key=value matching (case-insensitive) and wildcard `'*'` value to match any VM with a given tag key. Multiple tags are AND-combined. Can be used alongside `-SubscriptionId`, `-ManagementGroup`, and `-ResourceGroup`.
- **`-RateOptimization` flag** — New switch parameter that gates Savings Plan (SP) and Reserved Instance (RI) columns in lifecycle reports. By default, only PAYG pricing columns are shown with `-ShowPricing`. Adding `-RateOptimization` includes 4 savings columns: `SP 1-Year Savings`, `SP 3-Year Savings`, `RI 1-Year Savings`, `RI 3-Year Savings` showing fleet-wide savings vs PAYG for each commitment term. SP/RI pricing API calls are skipped entirely when the flag is not set, improving performance.
- **Lifecycle Recommendations mode** — `-LifecycleRecommendations` accepts CSV, JSON, or XLSX files (including native Azure portal exports) of deployed VM SKUs. Runs compatibility-validated recommendations for each SKU and produces a consolidated lifecycle risk summary with old-gen flagging, capacity/quota analysis, and up to 6 alternatives per SKU. `-LifecycleScan` pulls live inventory via Resource Graph. `-NoQuota` skips quota API calls. JSON output supported via `-JsonOutput`.
- **Hybrid recommendation strategy (3 AI + up to 3 weighted)** — Each retiring/old-gen SKU receives up to 6 recommendations: 3 from a curated upgrade path knowledge base (`data/UpgradePath.json`) and up to 3 from the real-time weighted scoring algorithm. Upgrade path recommendations are labeled `Upgrade: Drop-in` (lowest risk), `Upgrade: Future-proof` (latest gen), and `Upgrade: Cost-optimized` (AMD/alternative). Weighted recommendations provide availability-verified alternatives based on the 8-dimension scoring engine. The knowledge base covers 19 SKU families (11 retired, 8 scheduled) with vCPU-matched size maps and Microsoft's official migration guidance.
- **Upgrade path knowledge base** — `data/UpgradePath.json` (programmatic) and `data/UpgradePath.md` (human-readable reference) document Microsoft's recommended upgrade paths for every retired or retiring VM SKU family. Each entry provides 3 upgrade options with size maps, requirements (Gen2 OS, NVMe driver, etc.), and rationale.
- **Details column** — New column appended to console output and all XLSX sheets explaining *why* each recommendation was selected. Shows upgrade path reasons from the knowledge base (e.g., "Same family, SCSI disk, Gen1+Gen2 — safest migration from Dv2; Requires: Gen2 OS image, NVMe driver"), family upgrade context (e.g., "D-family v2→v5 upgrade"), cross-family explanations, IOPS guarantees, and resize impact.
- **Compatibility gate** — `Test-SkuCompatibility` enforces hard requirements (vCPU, memory, NICs, accelerated networking, premium IO, disk interface, ephemeral OS, Ultra SSD, burstable exclusion, vCPU ceiling 2x max) before scoring. Extended `Get-SkuCapabilities` extraction and 8-dimension similarity scoring (disk IOPS + data disk count added as soft dimensions).
- **Lifecycle XLSX auto-export** — styled 3-sheet XLSX report (Lifecycle Summary, High Risk, Medium Risk) with color-coded risk levels, Azure-blue headers, alternating rows, conditional formatting, and summary footer. Risk sheets correctly group continuation rows by parent SKU.
- **Pricing comparison** — monthly cost delta (`Price Diff`) and fleet-wide impact (`Total`) columns in console. XLSX adds 4 dedicated columns: `SP 1-Year`, `SP 3-Year`, `RI 1-Year`, `RI 3-Year` showing per-unit full-term costs for each alternative. Uses Azure Retail Pricing API `api-version=2023-01-01-preview`. Requires `-ShowPricing`.
- **VM retirement detection** — `Get-SkuRetirementInfo` flags SKUs on Microsoft's published retirement schedule as High risk. Shows "Retired YYYY-MM-DD" or "Retiring YYYY-MM-DD" in Risk Reasons. Covers 11 retired series (Av1, Dv1, G/GS, H, HBv1, HC, NCv1, NCv2, NDv1, NVv1, Lsv1) and 8 scheduled retirements (Dv2, Dv3, Ev3, Fsv1, NCv3, NDv2, NVv3, Mv1).
- `tools/Check-PRReadyToMerge.ps1` — pre-merge gate that lists all unreplied non-owner comment threads on the current PR (paginated, fails closed on API errors); exits non-zero if any are open
- `tools/Audit-AllPRComments.ps1` — audits all merged PRs (fetched dynamically from GitHub) for unreplied top-level non-owner threads; used for historical backlog review
- `tools/Reply-StaleThreads.ps1` — bulk-replies to unreplied non-owner threads on old PRs with a stale-finding notice (paginated, fails closed on API errors)
- **Branch protection**: enabled `required_review_thread_resolution` on main — GitHub now blocks merge until all PR conversation threads are resolved

### Fixed
- Added `edited` trigger type to `release-metadata-guard.yml` so PR body checkbox changes re-run the guard without needing an empty commit workaround
- **Corrected retirement dates** — Updated `Get-SkuRetirementInfo` with verified dates from Microsoft Learn: Dv1 (2028-05-01), Dv2 (2028-05-01), Fsv1 (2028-11-15), NVv3 (2026-09-30). Added Bv1 (2028-11-15) and Lsv2 (2028-11-15). Removed Dv3/Ev3 (no retirement announced). Marked NCv3 as Retired.
- **Lifecycle modes exempt from 5-region limit** — `-LifecycleRecommendations` and `-LifecycleScan` now scan all deployed regions regardless of the 5-region cap. Previously, `-NoPrompt` auto-truncated to 5 regions, causing missing pricing data for SKUs deployed in truncated regions.
- **Upgrade path recommendations now show real scan data** — Upgrade path target SKUs (v5, v6, AMD variants) are included in the Azure SKU scan filter and looked up from raw scan data when they fail the compatibility gate against the source SKU. Previously all upgrade recs showed "Not scanned" with missing fields; now they show real capacity status, vCPU/memory/disk/IOPS deltas, and pricing from the deployed region.
- Current-gen SKUs (v4+) no longer flagged High risk when no alternatives exist and no capacity/retirement issues present
- `Group-Object SKU` deduplication no longer reorders recommendations — explicit score sort before selection
- Quota-only current-gen SKUs correctly show "Request quota increase" instead of alternative SKUs
- XLSX High/Medium Risk sheets correctly filter by parent risk level, not row-level risk
- Lifecycle Summary sort stability via explicit group/row sequence numbers
- `tools/Validate-Script.ps1`: added `else` branch so a missing `AzVMAvailability.psd1` now registers as a version mismatch instead of silently skipping validation; error messages now use `$psd1Path` variable instead of hard-coded path string
- `artifacts/copilot-review-log.md`: removed duplicate PR #105 triage block

### Changed
- Similarity scoring rebalanced to 8 dimensions (added disk IOPS 8pts, data disk count 7pts). JSON contract includes `maxDisks`, `maxNICs`, `iops` fields.
- Broadened `.gitignore` for session/handoff docs

## [1.13.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Write-Host gating** — module-qualified `Write-Host` override; `-JsonOutput` suppresses all console output via `$script:SuppressConsole` flag
- **Pipeline emit guard** — objects only emitted to pipeline when `[Console]::IsOutputRedirected` is true; prevents noise in interactive terminal sessions
- New test files: `ConvertFrom-Rest.Tests.ps1`, `WriteHost-Gating.Tests.ps1`, `Invoke-WithRetry.Tests.ps1`
- 61 new test assertions in `HelperFunctions.Tests.ps1`

### Changed
- **HttpClient REST scan engine** — concurrent SKU+quota first-page fetch via `System.Net.Http.HttpClient`; parallel region scan via runspaces; ~20% faster scans
- **O(1) capability lookup** — `_CapIndex` hashtable in `Get-CapValue` replaces linear scan
- Broadened `.gitignore` patterns for session/handoff docs (`docs/*handoff*`, `docs/*session-notes*`)
- Removed accidentally committed session docs from tracking (local copies preserved in `docs/archive/`)

### Fixed
- **HTTP 500 retry** — `Invoke-WithRetry` now retries `InternalServerError`/`500` in addition to `429`/`503`
- **Scan timer** — per-subscription timer now excludes one-time pricing phase (was inflating reported scan time)
- **Regex injection** — SKU filter replaced `-match` (user input as regex) with `-like` operator + input validation
- **Write-Host pipeline bug** — added `process {}` block so piped input is handled per-item
- Added `edited` trigger type to `release-metadata-guard.yml` so PR body checkbox changes re-run the guard without needing an empty commit workaround

## [1.12.5] - 2026-03-27
- Adding GitHub Codespaces Support
- Updating Documentation

## [1.12.4] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- Restored inline function fallback so single-file downloads work without the AzVMAvailability/ module directory
- Added try/catch around Import-Module with graceful fallback to 34 inline function definitions
- Fixed silent auth failure: Get-AzAccessToken now uses -ErrorAction Stop
- Added cache check in Get-AzVMPricing to skip redundant API calls
- Replaced silent catch in Test-ImportExcelModule with Write-Verbose

## [1.12.3] - 2026-03-21

### Changed
- **Module scaffold:** Extracted all 34 functions from monolithic `Get-AzVMAvailability.ps1` into `AzVMAvailability/` module with Private/ subdirectory layout (#5)
- Root script now imports `AzVMAvailability` module instead of defining functions inline (2,028 lines removed from main script)
- Removed dead `$script:CachedValidRegions` variable

### Added
- `AzVMAvailability/AzVMAvailability.psd1` -- module manifest (declares Az module dependencies)
- `AzVMAvailability/AzVMAvailability.psm1` -- dependency-ordered dot-source loader
- 34 function files across `Private/Azure/`, `Private/SKU/`, `Private/Image/`, `Private/Fleet/`, `Private/Format/`, `Private/Utility/`
- `Find-FunctionInModule` in TestHarness.psm1 -- module-aware function discovery with AST caching and parse error checking

## [1.12.2] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- Synced 4 stale version references to 1.12.2: README badge, README sample output, ROADMAP Current Release, demo/DEMO-GUIDE.md
- Expanded `Validate-Script.ps1` Check 5 with 2 new validation points (README sample output, demo/DEMO-GUIDE.md) — now validates 7 locations for version drift

### Changed
- Replaced all 9 `exit` calls with `throw` (error paths) and `return` (user cancellation) for module safety — script no longer kills the caller's session when dot-sourced (#68)
- Converted 3 hot-loop `+=` array accumulations to `[System.Collections.Generic.List[T]]` in `Get-RestrictionDetails`, `$rows`, and `$familyDetails` (#70)
- Archived 9 internal process documents to `docs/archive/` (gitignored) — removes remediation artifacts from public repo (#74)
- Updated `copilot-instructions.md` with current metrics (4,442 lines, 34 functions, 349 Write-Host, 0 exit calls, 189 tests/11 files), line numbers, parent-scope dependency table, and module extraction order
- Updated `.github/workflows/collect-traffic.yml` to dual-checkout source + `traffic-data`, generate `dashboard.html`/`index.html` from `data/*.csv`, and commit static site files for GitHub Pages publishing
- Added daily release asset download snapshot collection (`data/release-downloads.csv`) and surfaced the metric in `Generate-TrafficDashboard-Premium-v2.ps1` dashboard cards

### Added
- 19 Pester tests for `-FleetFile` CSV/JSON parsing: column name matching, duplicate detection, validation rules, normalization, and `-Fleet`/`-FleetFile` mutual exclusion (#62)

### Fixed
- Inlined parallel scan logic into `ForEach-Object -Parallel` scriptblock — PowerShell prohibits `$using:` references to ScriptBlock variables, causing runtime errors in multi-region scans (#53)
- Fixed all parent-scope implicit dependencies in 9 functions — every function now takes explicit parameters instead of reading from parent scope (#72)
- Scoped `TRAFFIC_TOKEN` in traffic workflow to only the 4 `/traffic/*` API steps; non-traffic endpoints (stargazers, repo stats, releases) use `GITHUB_TOKEN` (Copilot review, PR #82)
- Set job-level `env.GH_TOKEN` in traffic workflow to reduce per-step duplication (Copilot review, PR #82)

## [1.12.1] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **`-FleetFile` parameter** — load fleet BOM from CSV or JSON file instead of inline hashtable. Accepts flexible column names (SKU/Name/VmSize, Qty/Quantity/Count). Removes the biggest adoption barrier for fleet readiness validation.
- **`-GenerateFleetTemplate` switch** — creates `fleet-template.csv` and `fleet-template.json` in the current directory with sample SKUs. No Azure login required. Eliminates guesswork about file format.
- Example fleet CSV at `examples/fleet-bom.csv` and JSON at `examples/fleet-bom.json`
- Fleet Planning Quick Start section in README with step-by-step guide
- Fleet workflow added to SKILL.md decision tree and Workflow 7 section for AI agent routing
- Fleet demo scenarios (7B, 7C) added to `demo/Demo-Commands.ps1`

## [1.12.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Fleet Readiness Mode** — `-Fleet` hashtable parameter for BOM-level capacity and quota validation (`-Fleet @{'Standard_D2s_v5'=17; 'Standard_D4s_v5'=4}`)
- Fleet auto-derives `-SkuFilter` from Fleet keys with double-prefix guard (`Standard_Standard_` → `Standard_`)
- `Get-FleetReadiness` function — validates fleet BOM against scan data, checks per-SKU capacity, aggregates vCPU demand per quota family with fuzzy family name matching fallback
- `Write-FleetReadinessSummary` function — color-coded console output with per-SKU table, per-family quota pass/fail (Used/Available/Limit), and overall verdict

### Changed
- Release workflow: push-to-main releases now auto-publish (not draft) — release notes are editable on GitHub without a new PR; manual dispatch still defaults to draft via `draft_release` input
- CI: Release workflow now fails on version stagnation — if `$ScriptVersion` matches an existing tag but HEAD has new commits, the workflow throws instead of silently passing. Every merge to main requires a version bump.

### Fixed
- Tooling: `Validate-Script.ps1` Check 5 docs scan now uses `git ls-files` instead of `Get-ChildItem` so only committed/staged files can trigger version-consistency failures — prevents false positives from local untracked scratch notes under `docs/`
- Tooling: `Validate-Script.ps1` Check 5 now guards `git ls-files` with `Get-Command git` — falls back to `Get-ChildItem` with a `WARN` when git is unavailable (e.g. source ZIP install), preventing a `CommandNotFoundException` crash
- Tooling: `Validate-Script.ps1` Check 5 now checks `$LASTEXITCODE` after `git ls-files` — if git exits non-zero (not a git worktree), emits `WARN` and falls back to `Get-ChildItem` instead of silently returning an empty file list and passing Check 5 trivially
- Tests: Strengthened RFC1123 `Invoke-WithRetry` integration test — changed `AddSeconds(3)` to `AddSeconds(300)` and assertion from `-ge 1` to `-ge 60`; default backoff (2s + jitter) can no longer satisfy the threshold, so header-parsing regressions are reliably caught
- Tests: Added end-to-end `Invoke-WithRetry` integration tests for `Retry-After` header parsing using `Add-Type` fake exception class with real `Response.Headers` dictionary and `Mock Start-Sleep` to exercise the actual `catch` path (189 tests total)

### Chores
- CI: Updated `actions/checkout` from `@v4` to `@v4.2.2` across all 4 workflow files — eliminates Node.js 20 deprecation warnings (Node.js 24 required by GitHub Actions from June 2026)

## [1.11.3] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- CI: Fixed `[Unreleased]` changelog guard regex that allowed empty sections to pass — `\s*` consumed newlines past the heading boundary, causing `(.*?)` to capture the next version's content instead of detecting an empty section
- Security: Clear auth token (`$headers['Authorization']` and `$token`) in `finally` blocks in `Get-ValidAzureRegions` and `Get-AzActualPricing` to prevent credential leakage on exception paths (G-S1)
- Resilience: `Invoke-WithRetry` now handles RFC 1123 HTTP-date `Retry-After` values (e.g. `Sun, 16 Mar 2026 14:00:00 GMT`) in addition to integer seconds, preventing premature retries under heavy throttling (G-B1)
- Reliability: Extended outer `try/finally` to cover the export section so `Restore-OriginalSubscriptionContext` is guaranteed to run even if the user presses Ctrl+C during XLSX/CSV generation (G-B2)

### Performance
- `Get-AzActualPricing`: Changed Cost Management OData filter from `contains(meterCategory,'Virtual Machines')` to exact `meterCategory eq 'Virtual Machines'`, eliminating a server-side full-scan (G-P4)

## [1.11.2] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- Startup version check gate (issue #41): `release-metadata-guard.yml` now requires at least one entry under `## [Unreleased]` for PRs that do not bump `$ScriptVersion`, closing the loophole where maintenance PRs bypassed all CHANGELOG enforcement
- Version regression guard: `release-on-main.yml` drift check now fails if `$ScriptVersion` is lower than the latest existing git tag — uses `[version]::TryParse()` for safe comparison (non-semver tags degrade to `Write-Warning` instead of hard-failing)

### Fixed
- `$ScriptVersion` corrected to `1.11.2` — the constant was never bumped past `1.11.0` despite v1.11.1 and three subsequent maintenance PRs shipping to `main`

### Changed (CI / Tooling — PRs #38–40, previously undocumented)
- **PR #38** — Expanded test coverage from 142 to 182 tests: added `tests/HelperFunctions.Tests.ps1` covering `Get-QuotaAvailable`, `Get-SkuCapabilities`, and `Get-RestrictionReason`; added `tests/FleetSafety.Tests.ps1` coverage for `Get-ProcessorVendor`; added `tests/ImageCompatibility.Tests.ps1` covering `Get-ImageRequirements` and `Test-ImageSkuCompatibility`; updated `$script:RunContext.Caches` to include an explicit `PlacementWarned403` key for placement-score 403 warning deduplication
- **PR #39** — Added `.github/workflows/scheduled-health-check.yml` (weekly PSScriptAnalyzer + Pester run on `main`); added PR template coverage gate requiring checklist completion before merge
- **PR #40** — Fixed 4 Copilot post-merge findings: cross-platform temp path (replaced hard-coded Windows temp path with `[System.IO.Path]::GetTempPath()` + `Join-Path`); backtick-escaped `$ScriptVersion` in YAML double-quoted PowerShell strings; `github.base_ref || 'main'` fallback for `workflow_dispatch` triggers

## [1.11.1] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- Copilot skill (`.github/skills/azure-vm-availability/SKILL.md`) for AI agent integration -- teaches coding agents when and how to invoke Get-AzVMAvailability via terminal
- README "AI Agent Integration" section with example agent invocations and installation instructions

## [1.11.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- `-ShowPlacement` parameter to display allocation likelihood scores (High/Medium/Low) for each SKU
- `-ShowSpot` parameter to include Spot VM pricing in pricing-enabled outputs
- `Get-PlacementScores` helper using `Invoke-AzSpotPlacementScore` (batched ≤5 SKUs × ≤8 regions)
- Placement score fields in Recommend JSON contract: `placementEnabled`, `allocScore`
- Spot pricing fields in Recommend JSON contract: `spotPricingEnabled`, `spotPriceHr`, `spotPriceMo`
- New helper `Get-SpotPricingMap` to safely read Spot pricing from region pricing containers
- New helper `Get-RegularPricingMap` to extract regular pricing from split pricing containers
- Interactive post-scan prompts for `-ShowPlacement` and `-ShowSpot` (fires after scan, before rendering; skipped when `-NoPrompt`)
- Placement score enrichment in filtered scan mode (when `-SkuFilter` selects ≤5 SKUs)
- New test files: `tests/PlacementScore.Tests.ps1`, `tests/SpotPricing.Tests.ps1`
- Contract coverage tests in `tests/RecommendJsonContract.Tests.ps1`

### Fixed
- `$script:RunContext` initialization missing `ShowPlacement`, `DesiredCount`, and `AzureEndpoints` properties (caused silent failures when placement or endpoint logic accessed these fields)

### Changed
- `Get-AzVMPricing` now returns separate Regular and Spot pricing maps instead of a single combined map
- Recommend console rendering now supports pricing/placement/spot combinations without breaking existing output modes

## [1.10.4] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- **Family summary Quota column now correctly displays `0`** — the truthiness check `if ($quotaInfo.Available)` treated `0` as falsy and showed `?` instead. Changed to explicit null check `if ($null -ne $quotaInfo.Available)` to match the per-SKU drill-down logic. Discovered via Copilot PR review triage on #26.

## [1.10.3] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- **Quota column now shows correct per-SKU family quota** — previously matched the broad family bucket (e.g., `Standard NC Family vCPUs`) instead of the specific sub-family (e.g., `Standard NCADS_A100_v4 Family vCPUs`), causing the tool to report available quota for GPU/HPC SKUs that actually had zero quota. Now uses each SKU's `.Family` property as an exact hash key into the quota data, eliminating regex-based matching entirely. Fixes #25.
- Built per-region quota lookup hash table for O(1) quota resolution instead of linear regex search per SKU.

## [1.10.2] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- Prevent startup failure when assigning `$script:RunContext.AzureEndpoints` by ensuring the property exists before assignment.
- `New-ScanOutputContract` now accepts empty scan collections so upstream scan errors do not cascade into contract-construction failures.
- Contract payload builders now use list-backed accumulation to avoid O(n^2) array append behavior in recommend JSON output construction.
- Family pricing lookup now consistently reads from `$script:RunContext.RegionPricing`.
- Per-subscription scan timing now reports elapsed time for each subscription independently.

### Changed
- PowerShell 7+ is now explicitly required; script emits a clear warning and exits when run in Windows PowerShell 5.1.
- Added README troubleshooting for execution-policy warnings (`Unblock-File`) and stale single-file download detection.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **"Consider Smaller" fallback** — when no recommended SKUs have OK capacity but smaller options exist, interactive output now suggests top 3 smaller alternatives
- New helper functions: `Use-SubscriptionContextSafely`, `Restore-OriginalSubscriptionContext`
- New test files: `tests/ContextManagement.Tests.ps1`, `tests/RecommendJsonContract.Tests.ps1`
- Stable output contract helpers: `New-RecommendOutputContract`, `New-ScanOutputContract`
- Recommend output renderer wrapper: `Write-RecommendOutputContract`
- Explicit run context object: `$script:RunContext` for scoped runtime/cache state

### Changed
- Non-interactive runs (`-NoPrompt`) now fail closed when Azure region validation metadata is unavailable
- Removed global `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Continue'` mutation; error behavior is now locally scoped
- Subscription scanning now isolates and restores Az context via `try/finally` to avoid caller context side effects
- Hot-loop `+=` accumulation replaced with `List[object]` in recommendation and image-search paths
- Recommend mode now builds a contract first and renders via wrapper in non-JSON output mode
- JSON output for scan mode now emits a stable contract envelope (`schemaVersion`, `mode`, `generatedAt`, `summary`, `families`, `regionErrors`)
- Region/pricing/image/runtime mutable state migrated to `$script:RunContext` scoped properties
- Removed `ShouldProcess` boilerplate from contract builder functions (pure in-memory, no side effects)
- Completed `$script:ImageReqs` → `$script:RunContext.ImageReqs` migration
- Session handoff docs excluded from git tracking via `.gitignore`

### Fixed
- `$script:ImageReqs` references were stale after Phase 4 contract refactor, silently disabling image compatibility checks
- Empty `List[object]` truthiness bug in offer search results (always evaluated `$true` unlike empty `@()`)
- `CompactOutput` parameter was declared but never referenced after suppression removal
- Code scanning alert: unused `$restored` variable in context management tests

## [1.10.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Fleet Safety Warnings** — detects and warns about mixed architectures, CPU vendors, temp disk configs, storage interfaces, and accelerated networking across recommended SKUs
- **`-AllowMixedArch` parameter** — opt-in to include ARM64 candidates when targeting x64 (or vice versa); default now filters to target architecture
- **`-SkipRegionValidation` parameter** — explicit override to bypass region validation when metadata lookup is unavailable
- **CPU column** in Recommend output — shows Intel/AMD/ARM for each candidate
- **Disk column** in Recommend output — shows storage config shortcode (NV+T, NVMe, SC+T, SCSI)
- **Disk codes legend** added to Recommend output footer
- New helper functions: `Get-ProcessorVendor`, `Get-DiskCode`
- JSON output now includes `cpu`, `disk`, `tempDiskGB`, `accelNet` fields and a `warnings` array
- 13 new Pester tests for `Get-ProcessorVendor` and `Get-DiskCode`

### Changed
- `Get-SkuCapabilities` now extracts `TempDiskGB`, `AcceleratedNetworkingEnabled`, and `NvmeSupport`
- Recommend table widened to accommodate new columns (base: 113→122, with pricing: 133→140)
- Architecture filtering enabled by default in Recommend mode (candidates must match target arch)

## [1.9.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- **Interactive Recommend Mode** — users can now discover VMs first, then find alternatives
  - After scanning/drill-down, prompted: *Find alternative SKUs for a specific VM? (y/N)*
  - Enter any discovered SKU name to run the capacity recommender on-the-fly
  - Works with `-EnableDrillDown` and `-ImageURN` (previously blocked)
- **Region validation** — new `Get-ValidAzureRegions` helper with REST API + `Get-AzLocation` fallback
  - Caches results per subscription for faster repeated calls
  - Filters invalid/unsupported regions before scanning

### Changed
- `-Recommend` parameter no longer conflicts with `-EnableDrillDown` or `-ImageURN`
- SKU name normalization (auto-adds `Standard_` prefix) works for both pre-specified and interactive inputs

## [1.8.1] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed
- **Tests**: avoid PowerShell automatic variable conflict by renaming local test data
- **Tests**: improved regex extraction for `Get-SkuSimilarityScore` to capture full function body

## [1.8.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- **Capacity Recommender** — new `-Recommend` parameter finds alternatives when a target SKU
  is unavailable or capacity-constrained
  - Scores all available SKUs by similarity to target (vCPU, memory, family, generation, architecture, premium IO)
  - Ranks results by availability + similarity score
  - Deduplicates across regions (keeps best region per SKU)
  - Color-coded console output: green (OK), yellow (LIMITED), dark yellow (constrained)
- **New parameters:**
  - `-Recommend` — target SKU name (auto-adds `Standard_` prefix if missing)
